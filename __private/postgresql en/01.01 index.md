### Introduction

Crunchy PostgreSQL lets you run your own production-grade PostgreSQL-as-a-Service on OpenShift/Kubernetes!

Powered by the <a href=https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator target="_blank">Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator</a>, Crunchy PostgreSQL automates and simplifies deploying and managing open source PostgreSQL clusters by providing the essential features you need to keep your PostgreSQL clusters up and running, including:

- PostgreSQL Cluster Provisioning: <a href=https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/architecture/provisioning/ target="_blank">Create, Scale, & Delete PostgreSQL clusters with ease</a>, while fully customizing your Pods and PostgreSQL configuration!
- High-Availability: Safe, automated failover backed by a <a href=https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/architecture/high-availability/ target="_blank">distributed consensus based high-availability solution</a>. Uses <a href=https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity target="_blank">Pod Anti-Affinity</a> to help resiliency; you can configure how aggressive this can be! Failed primaries automatically heal, allowing for faster recovery time. You can even create regularly scheduled backups as well and set your backup retention policy
- Disaster Recovery: Backups and restores leverage the open source <a href=https://www.pgbackrest.org/ target="_blank">pgBackRest</a> utility and <a href=https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/architecture/disaster-recovery/ target="_blank">includes support for full, incremental, and differential backups as well as efficient delta restores</a>. Set how long you want your backups retained for. Works great with very large databases!
- Monitoring: Track the health of your PostgreSQL clusters using the open source <a href=https://github.com/CrunchyData/pgmonitor target="_blank">pgMonitor</a> library.
- Clone: Create new clusters from your existing clusters with a simple pgo clone command.
- Full Customizability: Crunchy PostgreSQL for OpenShift makes it easy to get your own PostgreSQL-as-a-Service up and running on and lets make further enhancements to customize your deployments, including:
- Selecting different storage classes for your primary, replica, and backup storage
- Select your own container resources class for each PostgreSQL cluster deployment; differentiate between resources applied for primary and replica clusters!
- Use your own container image repository, including support imagePullSecrets and private repositories
- Bring your own trusted certificate authority (CA) for use with the Operator API server
- Override your PostgreSQL configuration for each cluster and much more!


### Create Operator Prerequisites

There are a few manual steps that the cluster administrator must perform prior to installing the PostgreSQL Operator. At the very least, it must be provided with an initial configuration.

First, select a namespace in which to install the PostgreSQL Operator. PostgreSQL clusters will also be deployed here. If it does not exist, create it now.

```execute
export PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=pgo
```

```execute
oc create namespace "$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE"
```

Next, clone the PostgreSQL Operator repository locally.

```execute
git clone -b v4.4.0 https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator.git
```

```execute
cd postgres-operator
```

**Security**

For the PostgreSQL Operator and PostgreSQL clusters to run in the recommended restricted <a href=https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html target="_blank">Security Context Constraint</a>, edit ```conf/postgres-operator/pgo.yaml``` and set ```DisableFSGroup```to ```true```.

**PostgreSQL Operator Configuration**

Edit ```conf/postgres-operator/pgo.yaml``` to configure the deployment. Edit ```Storage.storageos.StorageClass``` and set it to ```ibmc-block-bronze```. Look over all of the options and make any changes necessary for your environment. A <a href=https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/4.4.0/configuration/pgo-yaml-configuration/ target="_blank">full description of each option</a> is available in the documentation.

When the file is ready, upload the entire directory to the pgo-config ConfigMap.

```execute
oc -n "$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE" create configmap pgo-config \
  --from-file=./conf/postgres-operator
```

**Secrets**

Configure pgBackRest for your environment. If you do not plan to use AWS S3 to store backups, you can omit the aws-s3 keys below.

```execute
oc -n "$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE" create secret generic pgo-backrest-repo-config \
  --from-file=config=./conf/pgo-backrest-repo/config \
  --from-file=sshd_config=./conf/pgo-backrest-repo/sshd_config \
  --from-file=aws-s3-ca.crt=./conf/pgo-backrest-repo/aws-s3-ca.crt \
  --from-literal=aws-s3-key="<your-aws-s3-key>" \
  --from-literal=aws-s3-key-secret="<your-aws-s3-key-secret>"
```

**Certificates (optional)**

The PostgreSQL Operator has an API that uses TLS to communicate securely with clients. If you have a certificate bundle validated by your organization, you can install it now. If not, the API will automatically generate and use a self-signed certificate.

```execute
oc -n "$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE" create secret tls pgo.tls \
  --cert=/path/to/server.crt \
  --key=/path/to/server.key
```

### Install Operator

Once these resources are in place, the PostgreSQL Operator can be installed into the cluster.

**Create OperatorGroup object yaml**

```execute
cat <<'EOF'>operator-group.yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: pgo
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - pgo
```

```execute
oc create -f operator-group.yaml -n $PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE
```

**Create subscription object yaml file which will install Crunchy Postgres Operator**

```execute
cat <<'EOF'>operator-subscription.yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: "crunchy-postgres-operator"
spec:
  channel: stable
  name: crunchy-postgres-operator
  source: certified-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
EOF
```

```execute
oc create -f operator-subscription.yaml -n $PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE
```


### Setup PGO Client

Once the PostgreSQL Operator is installed in your OpenShift cluster, you will need to do a few things to use the <a href=https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/pgo-client/ target="_blank">PostgreSQL Operator Client</a>.

**Install PGO Client**

Download pgo client binaries:

```execute
wget --directory-prefix=/usr/local/bin/ https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator/releases/download/v4.4.0/pgo
```

Grant executable permission to pgo client binaries:

```execute
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pgo
```

Install the first set of client credentials and download the client certificates.

```execute
PGO_CMD=oc ./deploy/install-bootstrap-creds.sh
```

```execute
PGO_CMD=oc ./installers/kubectl/client-setup.sh
```

The client needs to be able to reach the PostgreSQL Operator API from outside the OpenShift cluster. Create an external service or forward a port locally.

```execute
oc -n "$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE" expose deployment postgres-operator
```

```execute
oc -n "$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE" create route passthrough postgres-operator --service=postgres-operator
```

```execute
export PGO_APISERVER_URL="https://$(oc -n "$PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE" get route postgres-operator -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}")"
```

**Verify connectivity using the pgo command.**

```execute
pgo version
```

Output:

```
pgo client version 4.4.0
pgo-apiserver version 4.4.0
```


### Create PostgreSQL Cluster

Execute below command to create postgres cluster with name ```my-pgo-cluster``, username ```testuser``` and password as ```P@ssw0rd123```

```execute
pgo create cluster my-pgo-cluster --username=testuser --password=P@ssw0rd123 -n $PGO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE
```
